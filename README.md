**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Problems</span>**

The panel contains a button for opening the doors, represented by the standard outward facing arrows symbol, which is good. However, there seems to be a missing button for closing the doors. The user must instead wait for the doors to close automatically, which wastes some time.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">What is Done Well</span>**

Other than the missing “Close” button, the other buttons on the panel are laid out well. The buttons pertaining to the floors are arranged in one column, in increasing order from the bottom to the top. This design makes sense, as the buttons for the floors are in the same order as the floors of the building themselves. Additionally, the button is highlighted in yellow, sending feedback to the user after it has been pressed.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Common Functions</span>**

The most common uses for an elevator control panel are to first call the elevator to the floor the user is on. Secondly, the user always selects a floor to travel to. Opening the elevator doors is another button that may be frequently used, to hold the doors open for other passengers. Users may need to close the doors occasionally, but most users wait for the doors to close automatically after selecting a floor. Rarely, users may need to activate an alarm in case of emergency, like if the elevator were to become stuck.

 The interface makes it very easy to perform common operations like floor selection and holding the door open. This interface is missing a button to close the doors, so this operation cannot be performed. However, the alarm button is well labeled and evident to the user, should an emergency occur. Furthermore, every button has a braille label, so blind users can still operate the interface.

The buttons are clearly labeled, so there should be no user confusion when selecting a floor to travel to. Additionally, there is a star symbol to indicate what floor the user is currently on. After making a selection, the chosen button lights up orange to confirm the selection, which is good feedback.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Possible User Mistakes</span>**

While most operations are easy to perform and receive feedback from, mistakes could be made. Firstly, users could spend a long time looking for the button to close the doors, as most people expect that button to appear somewhere on the panel. Secondly, there are three white “buttons” on the elevator that do not actually correlate to an operation. Obviously they are there to plug unused holes in the panel, but people may accidentally attempt to push one of these. Granted, there are no consequences for doing so.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Improvements</span>**

While the current design is acceptable, improvements can always be made. Firstly, the inclusion of a button to close the elevator doors. While not always needed, it would be nice to have the extra functionality, should some users require it. Secondly, I will make the design more compact, as the current design takes up a sizable amount of space. Removing the three false buttons will help achieve this, as this space can be used for functioning buttons. Finally, I will color code the different buttons to make them more distinguishable for user convenience. Call buttons will all share a color, but the remaining functionalities will all have unique coloring.
